An open platform to talk about your bad experiences with any company anonymously.



# Tech Stack

# How will it work ?
All the articles will be stored as markdown in particular folders in [Wrose company articles](https://github.com/WorseCompanies/worse-companies-articles)

For example **Got fired at Fkbook** will be `Fkbook\How I got fired for raising my voice\`
The directory will have a `README.md` with images as proof respect to their post.

Once user submits it through our form then from backend we will create a PR on articles repo then an authorized personal will review it and then merge it.

We will also implement OAuth, Reacaptcha to prevent spam.
